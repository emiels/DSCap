## About the Application

This app uses your input to predict the next word.
You can enter some text 
(only English vocabulary gives a reasonable prediction)
Based on the last three words up to five possible next words
are presented in a word cloud and on the line below your input line.

The best fitting next word can be selected using the button; 
other possibilities (including your own) must be entered manually.
When you update the sentence, the app recalculates the predicted words.

Have fun!!
